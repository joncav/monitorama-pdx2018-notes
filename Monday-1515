# Observability: the Hard Parts
## Peter Bourgon, @peterbourgon
## From Fastly, 120 engineers

### Goals
Is the system healthy?
If not why not?

- Run Prometheus
- Duplicate instrumentation that works
- Prometheus exporters
- Curate dashboards

### Rollout
- Inventory all services

The grind
- Pair up with responsible engineer
- Learn how the Prometheus model works
- Build and maintain Empathy

1. Instrument
 - Hour of pare programming
 - Mistake trying to layout process up front
 - Better: letting documentation emerge naturally
 - Documentation portal extremely helpful
2. Wire-up
 - Deploy Prometheus
 - Plumb service into Prometheus
 - Heterogeneous deployments made difficult

Code: Engineering autonomy
- Orgs must balance local vs global optimization
- Tech autonomy is a form of tech debt

Coda: Empathy
- de-learning helplessness
- understanding problems/concerns others face

### The politics of ownership
- Some services are nebulously owned
- Must have C level buy in

Tricky bits
- Empathy vs learned helplessness 
- Resistance before "production-ready"
- Socializing infrastructural knowledge 
- Alert manager

### Successful
- Team of two is a good mix
- Consulting model works, real change requires connection
- Prometheus, simple, stable and adaptable
- GitOps-style of resource management

### Questions:
1. Size of company
2. How did this project / putting people on call correspond?
 - Transition, there were already on-call engineers, could be increasing
3. How did you get engineers to maintain the systems after leaving teams?
 - Hard question: The ideal is systems should be owned. Ownership is the one or two people who wrote it. The on-call rotation could be an indicator of who should own it. Have a team who receives systems in maintenances mode, as lifecycle and they manage it and hand it back off.
4. What was the handoff process like, consulting to production.
 - Leaving an embed, on the intro email, introducing themselves and about observability story when I leave then the system belongs to you. Made clear at the beginning. Consistent communication is the key.
