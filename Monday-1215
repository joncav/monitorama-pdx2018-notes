# Principia SLOdica - A Treatise on the Metrology of Service Level Objectives
## By Jamie Wilkinson

- Measure on bad experience
- Error budget, is the acceptable level of errors, reasonable tolerance

- SLI - Indicator: A measurement
- SLO - Objective: A goal
- SLA - Agreement

- Know what your reasonable tolerance is, within your SLA
- SLO would be how many requests are successful and if this is within tolerance

### Monitoring SLO
TSDB
- Measure over time
- Report if reaches over threshold
- All response codes in the last 10s / number of requests (if yes, then error)

### Burn rate
- Disk space, consumption rate example
- Burn rate should be the measurement, not just static percent, or when disk is full
- Burn rate math, calculate what you are capable of over a time period, and notice on higher

Showed demo of Prometheus, didn't work :(

Monitoring is not a substitute for debugging!

1. Symptom based alerts are good for your health
2. SLO is defined by you, customers, systems
3. SLO implies error budget, informs engineering tolerance
4. Page only SLO risk, because that's what matters
