# Principia SLOdica - A Treatise on the Metrology of Service Level Objectives
## By Jamie Wilkinson

- Measure on bad experience
- Error budget, is the acceptable level of errors, reasonable tolerance

- SLI - Indicator: A measurement
- SLO - Objective: A goal
- SLA - Agreement

- Know what your reasonable tolerance is, within your SLA
- SLO would be how many requests are successful and if this is within tolerance

### Monitoring SLO
TSDB
- Measure over time
- Report if reaches over threshold
- All response codes in the last 10s / number of requests (if yes, then error)

### Burn rate
- Disk space, consumption rate example
- Burn rate should be the measurement, not just static percent, or when disk is full
- Burn rate math, calculate what you are capable of over a time period, and notice on higher

Showed demo of Prometheus, didn't work :(

Monitoring is not a substitute for debugging!

1. Symptom based alerts are good for your health
2. SLO is defined by you, customers, systems
3. SLO implies error budget, informs engineering tolerance
4. Page only SLO risk, because that's what matters

# On-call Simulator! - Building an interactive game for teaching incident response
## By Franka Schmidt, @franschm, franka.tech
## From MapBox

### Games and incident response, on-call on-boarding
- For your systems
- For your team
- For the onboardee

- Recommended: Rise of the video game zinesters

### Buddy system
- They shadow the incident response person
- They can run the queries/check things
- After 3rd time/day the mentor shadows you

### On-boarding bucket list
- List of experiences (gamify)
- (cool) You can do this at any time, read, document
- (rain) This depends on the weather, like tasks that require something to be done
- (rare) Something special. Maybe a support case with AWS, look for handoff for learning

### Alarm scrum
- Alarms that came up the day before
- Triage steps/outcomes

### Low stakes environment
1. ??
2. Game, craft a story
Use past incidents
Enrich with detail
3. Iterate and get feedback

- Recommended: Twine for games
