# Optimized for Learning
## By Logan McDonald, @loganmeetsworld

1. Preparation:
 - Problem solving is easier with constraints
 - Dickerson Hierarchy, in SRE. Scoping out the path
2. Gaining knowledge:
 - Storing and linking long term memory is mandatory 
 - Low stakes testing
 - If you find something you don’t know, write down and then write question. Don’t flip until you know
 - To learn, retrieve. To learn, struggle
 - Sebastian Leitner, (Book Title: so learnt man Lerner), three boxes, iterate through
 - Memory palaces
3. Mental models:
 - Find a mascot, the gobi
 - Create mental models, so that we can survive problems 
 - Observability, reflection, practice active reflection will level you up faster
 - Incident reviews for her helped ask questions
4. Learning together: 
 - 'symmathesy, sharing what your team is doing with their queries, transparency
 - Emphasizing on natural inte
 lligence doesn’t have rewards, but pointing out the hard work/effort
 - Create a safe place, where teams feel like they are solving hard problems together

# Mentoring Metrics Engineers: How to Grow and Empower Your Own Monitoring Experts
## By Zach Musgrave, Angelo Licastro
 
### Stats:
- 25min data points per min
- 30tb per day, splunk
- Beginning datalake 

### Growth
 - internal and external growth, this is what they experienced and are also applicable to self
 - Growth Challenges, knowldge gaps, more meetings
 - Knowledge silos

### Phases of mentorship
1. Bredth
* get up to speed on what we do
2. Depth
3. ??

- Retrospectives allow to discuss, give feedback quickly
- Make intros, continue making connections for your trainees, do it soon

### Make the right tradeoffs
- Consult with other teams, communicate, this helps them
- Pose the problem your trying to solve
- Point people to insightful questions

* Teaching others
* Retrospectives allow to discuss, give feedback quickly
* A mentors social network
* Make intros, continue making connections for your trainees, do it soon

Consulting: Metrics as a services
* Why: Specalized field, Monitorama is awesome for learning

Make the right tradeoffs
* Consult with other teams, communicate, this helps them
* Pose the problem your trying to solve
* Point people to insightful questions 

Best Practice
- Listen attentively, intentionally

# On-call Simulator! - Building an interactive game for teaching incident response
## By Franka Schmidt @dparzych

### Story telling
1. Too much info, Helps us remember
2. Stories add meaning, add meaning add context, time is constrained
3. Stories help us combat the biases, to remember the important we tell ourselves stories
4. Not enough memory

*Story has elements, plot, setting, characters, theme, conflict*

We identify with characters we have empathy for
- Look through others eyes
- Recognize the emotions of the people you're talking to
- Make stories exciting and entertaining
KISS method
- Keep it simple
- Not for letting people know how much you know
- Use visuals, but keep them simple

Rule of three
- Many things are set in threes because the brain can easily grasp
- First digit that allows you to see a pattern
- Focus on three data points you're trying to convey

**Metrics tell a story**

1. Simple
2. Use visuals
3. Remember the power of 3

# Principia SLOdica - A Treatise on the Metrology of Service Level Objectives
## By Jamie Wilkinson

- Measure on bad experience
- Error budget, is the acceptable level of errors, reasonable tolerance

- SLI - Indicator: A measurement
- SLO - Objective: A goal
- SLA - Agreement

- Know what your reasonable tolerance is, within your SLA
- SLO would be how many requests are successful and if this is within tolerance

### Monitoring SLO
TSDB
- Measure over time
- Report if reaches over threshold
- All response codes in the last 10s / number of requests (if yes, then error)

### Burn rate
- Disk space, consumption rate example
- Burn rate should be the measurement, not just static percent, or when disk is full
- Burn rate math, calculate what you are capable of over a time period, and notice on higher

Showed demo of Prometheus, didn't work :(

Monitoring is not a substitute for debugging!

1. Symptom based alerts are good for your health
2. SLO is defined by you, customers, systems
3. SLO implies error budget, informs engineering tolerance
4. Page only SLO risk, because that's what matters
