 - Low stakes testing
 - If you find something you don’t know, write down and then write question. Don’t flip until you know
 - To learn, retrieve. To learn, struggle
 - Sebastian Leitner, (Book Title: so learnt man Lerner), three boxes, iterate through

### Story telling
1. Too much info, Helps us remember
2. Stories add meaning, add meaning add context, time is constrained
3. Stories help us combat the biases, to remember the important we tell ourselves stories
4. Not enough memory

*Story has elements, plot, setting, characters, theme, conflict*

We identify with characters we have empathy for
- Look through others eyes
- Recognize the emotions of the people you're talking to
- Make stories exciting and entertaining
KISS method
- Keep it simple
- Not for letting people know how much you know
- Use visuals, but keep them simple

Rule of three
- Many things are set in threes because the brain can easily grasp
- First digit that allows you to see a pattern
- Focus on three data points you're trying to convey

**Metrics tell a story**

1. Simple
2. Use visuals
3. Remember the power of 3
