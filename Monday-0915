1. Preparation: 
* Problem solving is easier with constraints
* Dickerson Hierarchy, in SRE. Scoping out the path
2. Gaining knowledge:
* Storing and linking long term memory is mandatory 
* Low stakes testing
* If you find something you don’t know, write down and then write question. Don’t flip until you know
* To learn, retrieve. To learn, struggle
* Sebastian Leitner, (Book Title: so learnt man Lerner) - three boxes, iterate through
* Memory palaces
3. Mental models:
* Find a mascot, the gobi
* Create mental models, so that we can survive problems 
* Observability, reflection, practice active reflection will level you up faster
* Incident reviews for her helped ask questions
4. Learning together:

Story telling
Too much info, Helps us remember
Stories add meaning, add meaning add context, time is constrained
Stories help us combat the biases, to remember the important we tell ourselves stories
Not enough memory
Story has elements, plot, setting, characters, theme, conflict
We identify with characters we have empathy for
* Look through others eyes
* Recognize the emotions of the people you're talking to
* Make stories exciting and entertaining
KISS method
* Keep it simple
* Not for letting people know how much you know
* Use visuals, but keep them simple
Rule of three
* Many things are set in threes because the brain can easily grasp
* First digit that allows you to see a pattern
* Focus on three data points you're trying to convey
Metrics tell a story

1. Simple
2. Use visuals
3. Remember the power of 3
